# haveibeenpwned-api
A small ruby script that utilizes the haveibeenpwned.com api to check if the user's password have been breached before.

Run the script on Linux Terminal using the following form: ruby pwned.rb \<password\>
  
If your password is in the database, the script will print out the number of times it has been breached.
